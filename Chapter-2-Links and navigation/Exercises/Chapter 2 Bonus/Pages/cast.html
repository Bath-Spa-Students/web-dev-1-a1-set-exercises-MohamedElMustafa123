        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shameik_Moore" target="_blank">Shameik Moore</a> as Miles Morales / Spider-Man:</h4>
        <p class="desc">An intelligent and rebellious teenager of African-American and Puerto Rican descent, who is imbued with spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider and eventually takes up the mantle of the masked vigilante Spider-Man. Producers Lord and Miller described the character as unique among Spider-Men because of his Brooklyn upbringing, his African-American and Puerto-Rican background, and the fact that his family is still alive,[10] with that family dynamic being central to the film's story.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Johnson" target="_blank">Jake Johnson</a> as Peter B. Parker / Spider-Man:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Miles' reluctant mentor, a disheveled, jaded, and brown-haired 38-year-old counterpart of the hero from another dimension. He is intended to be an amalgamation of all pop culture Spider-Man adaptations and interpretations. Lord and Miller envisioned him to be like The Karate Kid's Mr. Miyagi, if "Mr. Miyagi doesn't know anything," which they thought was a "really neat color to put onto Peter that we hadn't seen before."</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailee_Steinfeld" target="_blank">Hailee Steinfeld</a> as Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman:</h4>
        <p class="desc">A dimension-displaced counterpart of Gwen Stacy with spider-like abilities, who takes up the alias of "Wanda" (mistaken as "Gwanda") while at Miles' school. In onscreen comic books while explaining her origin story, she is referred to as "Spider-Gwen".</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahershala_Ali" target="_blank">Mahershala Ali</a> as Aaron Davis / Prowler:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Miles' uncle, who moonlights as a masked enforcer for Wilson Fisk while keeping it a secret from his family. He is rebellious, causing him to be looked at poorly by Jefferson.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry" target="_blank">Brian Tyree Henry</a> as Jefferson Davis:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Miles' African-American father, a police officer, who disapproves of Spider-Man's vigilante actions. At the age of 35, Henry had said he was too young to portray a father of a teenager, but agreed to the role after learning that Miles Morales was the only black, Latino Spider-Man.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Tomlin" target="_blank">Lily Tomlin</a> as May Parker:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Peter's aunt, who is dead in Peter B. Parker's universe, and provides refuge for the other Spider-People in Miles' universe</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_V%C3%A9lez" target="_blank">Luna Lauren Vélez</a> as Rio Morales:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Miles' Puerto-Rican mother, a nurse.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Kravitz" target="_blank">Zoë Kravitz</a> as Mary Jane "MJ" Parker:</h4>
        <p class="desc">Peter Parker's wife in Miles' universe and Peter B. Parker's former wife in his universe.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mulaney" target="_blank">John Mulaney</a> as Peter Porker / Spider-Ham:</h4>
        <p class="desc">An alternate talking animal version of Spider-Man from an anthropomorphic universe, who was once a spider, bitten by a radioactive pig.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimiko_Glenn" target="_blank">Kimiko Glenn</a> as Peni Parker / SP//dr:</h4>
        <p class="desc">A young Japanese-American girl from an alternative anime-like universe who copilots a biomechanical suit with a radioactive spider that she shares a telepathic link with. The filmmakers initially considered using Silk as their Asian-American Spider-Man, but eventually settled on Peni because of her more distinctive power set compared to the other Spider-People. Peni's designs went through a few iterations as her initial design was particularly "iffy." Production designer Justin Thompson considered Lord and Miller's desire to use an anime design and came up with the idea to portray her in an art style similar to Sailor Moon.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" target="_blank">Nicolas Cage</a> as Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir:</h4>
        <p class="desc">An alternate version of Peter Parker from a monochromatic universe set in the 1930s. Cage based his character on the films of Humphrey Bogart, and the voices of actors from that era such as James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hahn" target="_blank">Kathryn Hahn</a> as Doctor Olivia "Liv" Octavius:</h4>
        <p class="desc">The head scientist and CEO of Alchemax, and a scientific adviser to Wilson Fisk. The character uses highly advanced tentacles and is featured in much of the marketing for Alchemax, even being seen in a documentary by Miles in school.</p>
        <h4><a class="actors"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liev_Schreiber" target="_blank">Liev Schreiber</a> as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin:</h4>
        <p class="desc">A crime lord and the benefactor of Alchemax in Miles' dimension. His ultimate motive is to abduct alternate versions of his late wife and son, who died in a car crash escaping from him.</p>
